Hey! This is a spot for me to track my own progress and be able to reference back to what projects I'm working on or things I'm learning. I'm in blue team secops but always wanting to make my skills more robust. Currently some of the projects I have in mind for this space are following a couple of books regarding hacking, CTFs, and looking at more red team perspectives. My scripting experience is minimal so that is something I want to work on building that up as well. We'll see how it all goes!
