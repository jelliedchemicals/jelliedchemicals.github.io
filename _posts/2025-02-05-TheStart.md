<h3>The Introduction</h3>

Hey y'all. I'm an infosec professional in blue team SecOps who still has a lot to learn, as we always do. It's been a goal of mine to create this site early in 2025 and just have a space to track the things I learn and work on.

I currently do CTFs on THM and Pico, take courses through THM, Udemy, etc, watch infosec youtube channels, and have a couple of hacking books I want to dive into. Having this space will be a way for me to delve more deeply into those resources and keep track of the progress I make while being able to reference back to what I've done.

Overall, a lot of my skills in exploitation, hacking, and scripting are currently rudimentary at best, and part of my goal for this site is to build out all of those skillsets further. I'm interested in diving into C and assembly further, python scripting, hacking techniques and CTFs, and so on. I might also cover some other things like work on my home lab, resume work and job hunting, and other things that come up.

Longer term, some infosec pathways I'm interested in include malware analysis. If I want to get there, I have a long, *long* way to go.

So, I just have to start.
